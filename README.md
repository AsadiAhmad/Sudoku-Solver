a valid sudoku should have each 1 to 9 number in each row, column and 3 * 3 Square.

## About BackTrack

BackTrack is a one of the brute force methods works like a searching in tree with DFP (Depth-first search) heuristic. also Backtrack generates all possible states and we can reach the answer with confidence.
also Backtrack is algorithm used in AI. we can optimize the backtrack algorithm with proning the branchs and we call that intellijence backtrack!

## How to use

```python
python BackTrack.py
```

you can use this as input:
```python
3 0 6 5 0 8 4 0 0
5 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
